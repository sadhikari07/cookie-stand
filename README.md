We have created a website for our friend Pat and his new business Pat's Salmon Cookies. 

On part 1 of this project, we did the following:{
This webpage utilizes JS, CSS and HTML. 
Pat wanted to get a website that would give him total cookies per hours in each location.
There are five lists to show total cookies consumption each hour in different locations.

On the second part of the project, we made following changes:
We used constructor functions which helped us reduce the number of times we were repeating the codes.
We started using loops to help us minimize the lines of codes we were writing. 

I referenced Sam's codes from classroom activity ery much to help me get this project right. 
Dana had to guide me through each steps and much thanks to her, this project is up and running.
