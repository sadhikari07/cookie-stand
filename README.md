We have created a website for our friend Pat and his new business Pat's Salmon Cookies. 
This webpage utilizes JS, CSS and HTML. 
Pat wanted to get a website that would give him total cookies per hours in each location.
There are five lists to show total cookies consumption each hour in different locations.
